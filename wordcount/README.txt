# A Django based word counting application

Hey Miracle I thought you would like some software by yours truly. Its really
nothing special at all but, I thought it would be fun to send it your way.

version = 0.1

#System Dependencies for the software:

pip install virtualenv

#Installation process:

You will need to pop open a shell and  navigate to the wordcount directory
and use the command: source bin/activate to activate the Python virtual 
enviroment. Once it is activated and while in in the same directory, use the 
command: pip install -r requirements.txt to install the correct dependencies.

#Running the application:

Finally the fun part. You will need to navigate to wordcount/wordcount-project
directory and use the command python main.py runserver. Like I said its just a
 simple little word counter so its pretty self explanatory. Have a good one
and happy hacking. Maybe you can improve this package if you get bored.
